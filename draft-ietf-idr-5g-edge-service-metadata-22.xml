    <abstract>
      <t>This draft describes a new Metadata Path Attribute and some Sub-TLVs
      for egress routers to advertise the Metadata about the attached edge
      services (ES). The edge service Metadata can be used by the ingress
      routers in the 5G Local Data Network to make path selections not only
      based on the routing cost but also the running environment of the edge
      services. The goal is to improve latency and performance for 5G edge
      services.</t>

      <t>The extension enables an edge service at one specific location to be
      more preferred than the others with the same IP address (ANYCAST) to
      receive data flow from a specific source, like a specific User Equipment
      (UE).</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes a new Metadata Path Attribute added to a BGP
      UPDATE message <xref target="RFC4271"/> for egress routers to advertise
      the Metadata about 5G low latency edge services directly attached to the
      egress routers. 5G <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>is characterized by
      having edge services closer to the Cell Towers reachable by Local Data
      Networks (LDN). From IP network perspective, the 5G LDN is a limited
      domain <xref target="RFC8799"/> with edge services a few hops away from
      the ingress nodes. Only selective UE services are considered as 5G low
      latency edge services.</t>

      <t>Note: The proposed edge service Metadata Path Attribute are not
      intended for the best-effort services reachable via the public internet.
      The information carried by the Metadata Path Attribute can be used by
      the ingress routers to make path selections for selective low latency
      services based on not only the network distance but also the running
      environment of the edge cloud sites. The goal is to improve latency and
      performance for 5G ultra-low latency services.</t>

      <t>The extension is targeted for a single domain with RR controlling the
      propagation of the BGP UPDATE. The edge service Metadata Path Attribute
      is only attached to the low latency services (routes) hosted in the 5G
      edge cloud sites, which are only a small subset of services initiated
      from UEs, not for UEs accessing many internet sites.</t>

      <t>While the proposed Metadata Path Attribute is particularly beneficial
      for low latency services, the metadata path attributes can be expanded
      to propagate information about GPU availability, power, or other
      resources necessary for compute-intensive services such as AI and
      machine learning. This flexibility makes it a valuable tool for a wide
      range of applications beyond just low latency services.</t>

    <section title="Metadata Influenced Ingress Node Behavior">
      <t>The goal of this edge service Metadata Path Attribute is for egress
      routers to propagate the metrics about the running environment for a
      subset of edge services to ingress routers so that the ingress routers
      can make path selections based on not only the routing cost but also the
      running environment for those edge services. The BGP speakers that do
      not support the Metadata Path Attribute can ignore the Metadata Path
      Attribute in a BGP UPDATE Message. All intermediate nodes can forward
      the entire BGP UPDATE as it is. Multiple metrics can be attached to one
      Metadata Path Attribute. One Metadata Path Attribute can contain
      computing service capability information, computing service states,
      computing resource states of the corresponding edge site, or more.
      Computing service capability information can be used to record
      information of the computing power node or initialization deployment
      information for computing service initialization. Computing service
      states can include one of the service connection numbers, service
      duration, and so on. Computing resource states can be detailed
      information on computing resources such as CPU/GPU. They can also be an
      abstract metric from these detailed parameters to indicate the resource
      status of the edge site. There could be more metrics about the running
      environment being attached to the Metadata Path Attribute, e.g., some of
      the metrics being discussed by the CATS WG. This document illustrates a
      few examples of Sub-TLVs of the metrics under the edge service Metadata
      Path Attribute:</t>

      <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="-">the site physical availability index</t>

        <t hangText="-">the site preference index</t>

        <t hangText="-">the service delay predication index x, and</t>

        <t hangText="-">the raw load measurement.</t>
      </list>

      <t>This section specifies how those Metadata impact the ingress node's
      path selections.</t>

      <section title="Metadata Influenced BGP Path Selection">
        <t>When an ingress router receives BGP updates for the same IP prefix
        from multiple egress routers, all these egress routers' loopback
        addresses are considered as the next hops for the IP prefix. For the
        selected low latency edge services, the ingress router BGP engine
        would call an edge service Management function that can select paths
        based on the edge service Metadata received. Section 5.1 has an
        exemplary algorithm to compute the weighted path cost based on the
        edge service Metadata carried by the Sub-TLV(s) specified in this
        document.</t>

        <t>Section 5 has the detailed description of the edge service Metadata
        influenced optimal path selection.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Ingress Router Forwarding Behavior">
        <t>When the ingress router receives a packet and does a lookup on the
        route in the FIB, it gets the destination prefix's whole path. It
        encapsulates the packet destined towards the optimal egress node.</t>

        <t>For subsequent packets belonging to the same flow, the ingress
        router needs to forward them to the same egress router unless the
        selected egress router is no longer reachable. Keeping packets from
        one flow to the same egress router, a.k.a. Flow Affinity, is supported
        by many commercial routers. Most registered EC services have
        relatively short flows.</t>

        <t>How Flow Affinity is implemented is out of the scope for this
        document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Forwarding Behavior when UEs Move">
        <t>When a UE moves to a new 5G gNB which is anchored to the same UPF,
        the packets from the UE traverse to the same ingress router. Path
        selection and forwarding behavior are same as before.</t>

        <t>If the UE maintains the same IP address when anchored to a new UPF,
        the directly connected ingress router might use the information passed
        from a neighboring router to derive the optimal Next Hop for this
        route. The detailed algorithm is out of the scope of this
        document.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Edge Service Metadata Encoding">
      <section title="Metadata Path Attribute">
        <t>The Metadata Path Attribute is an optional non-transitive BGP Path
        attribute to carry metrics and metadata about the edge services
        attached to the egress router. The Metadata Path Attribute, to be
        assigned by IANA <xref target="RFC2042"/>, consists of a set of
        Sub-TLVs, and each Sub-TLV contains information for specific metrics
        of the edge services.</t>

        <section title="Metadata Path Attribute Characteristics">
          <t>Only a small subset of BGP UPDATE messages include the Metadata
          Path Attribute. The choice of which prefix to carry the Metadata
          Path Attribute is determined by local policies. The Metadata Path
          Attribute can be included in a BGP UPDATE message <xref
          target="RFC4271"/> together with other BGP Path Attributes <xref
          target="IANA-BGP-PARAMS"/>, such as Communities <xref
          target="RFC4360"/>, NEXT_HOP, Tunnel Encapsulation Path Attribute
          <xref target="RFC9012"/>, etc.</t>

          <t>The metadata Path Attribute has the following
          characteristics:</t>

          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="-">Non-transitive</t>

            <t hangText="-">Boundary node filtering SHOULD be deployed to
            remove the BGP Metadata Path attribute at the administrative
            boundary to prevent the distribution of the BGP Metadata Path
            Attribute beyond its intended scope of applicability.</t>

            <t hangText="-">Can be packed with NLRI(AFI/SAFI) Unicast (1/1,

            Anycast <xref target="RFC4786"/>.</t>

            <t hangText="-">MUST contain at least one metadata Sub-TLV.
            Multiple Metadata Sub-TLVs can be included in a Metadata Path
            Attribute in one BGP UPDATE message. The choice of the Sub-TLVs
            present in the BGP Metadata Path attribute is determined by the
            local policies. Multiple Sub-TLVs may be carried by a single BGP
            Metadata Path Attribute.</t>
          </list>

          <t>The metrics Sub-TLVs included in the Metadata Path Attribute
          apply to all the address families carried in the NLRI field of the
          BGP UPDATE message <xref target="RFC4271"/>. For a multi-protocol
          BGP UPDATE message <xref target="RFC4760"/> <xref
          target="RFC7606"/>, the metrics Sub-TLVs included in the Metadata
          Path Attribute apply to all the AFIs/SAFIs address families carried
          by the MP_REACH_NLRI.</t>

        <section title=" Metadata Path Attribute Processing">
          <t>A BGP speaker that advertises a path received from one of its
          neighbors SHOULD advertise the BGP Metadata Path attribute received
          with the path without modification as long as the BGP Metadata Path
          attribute was acceptable. If the path did not come with a BGP
          Metadata Path attribute, the speaker MAY attach a BGP Metadata
          Attribute to the path if configured to do so.</t>

          <t>A BGP Peer receiving a BGP Metadata Path attribute should ignore
          Sub-TLVs with unknown types and process the recognized Sub-TLVs. BGP
          Peers should not delete any Sub-TLV from the BGP Metadata Path
          Attribute.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Sub-TLVs Data Processing">
          <t>By default, a BGP speaker does not report any unrecognized
          Sub-TLVs within a Metadata Path Attribute unless configured to send
          a notification to its management system. The ingress node should be
          configured with an algorithm to combine the recognized metrics
          carried by the Sub-TLVs within a Metadata Path Attribute of the
          received BGP UPDATE message.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Metadata Path Attribute Handling Procedure">
          <t>The Metadata Path Attribute MUST contain at least one metadata
          Sub-TLV. Multiple Metadata Sub-TLVs can be included in a Metadata
          Path Attribute in one BGP UPDATE message. The content of the
          Sub-TLVs present in the BGP Metadata Path attribute is determined by
          the configuration. When a BGP Speaker does not recognize some of the
          Sub-TLVs within one Metadata Path Attribute in a BGP UPDATE message,
          the BGP Speaker should forward the received BGP UPDATE message
          without any change if the transitive bit is set to 1 <xref
          target="RFC4271"/>. The domain ingress nodes should process the
          recognized Sub-TLVs carried by the Metadata Path Attribute and
          ignore the unrecognized Sub-TLVs. By default, a BGP speaker does not
          report any unrecognized Sub-TLVs within a Metadata Path Attribute
          unless configured to send a notification to its management system.
          The ingress node should be configured with an algorithm to combine
          the recognized metrics carried by the Sub-TLVs within a Metadata
          Path Attribute of the received BGP UPDATE message.</t>

          <t>The metrics Sub-TLVs included in the Metadata Path Attribute
          apply to all the address families carried in the NLRI field of the
          BGP UPDATE message <xref target="RFC4271"/>. For a multi-protocol
          BGP UPDATE message <xref target="RFC4760"/> <xref
          target="RFC7606"/>, the metrics Sub-TLVs included in the Metadata
          Path Attribute apply to all the AFIs/SAFIs address families carried

        Index to 50% for all the routes in those shelves. The value is 0-100,
        with 100% indicating the site is fully functional, 0% indicating the
        site is entirely out of service, and 50% indicating the site is 50%
        degraded.</t>

        <t>It is recommended to assign each route with one Site-ID. Depending
        on deployment, one DC can use POD number as Site-ID, another DC can
        use Row of Shelves as the Site-ID.</t>

        <t>Cloud Site/Pod failures and degradation include but are not limited
        to, a site degradation or an entire site going down caused by a
        variety of reasons, such as fiber cut connecting to the site or among
        pods, cooling failures, insufficient backup power, cyber threats
        attacks, too many changes outside of the maintenance window, etc.
        Fiber-cut is not uncommon within a Cloud site or between sites.</t>

        <t>When those failure events happen, the edge (egress) router is
        running fine. Therefore, the ingress routers with paths to the egress
        router can't use BFD to detect the failures.</t>

        <t>When there is a failure occurring at an edge site (or a pod), many
        instances can be impacted. In addition, the routes (i.e., the IP
        addresses) in the site might not be aggregated nicely. Instead of many
        BGP UPDATE messages to the ingress routers for all the instances, i.e.
        routes, impacted, the egress router can send one single BGP UPDATE to
        indicate the capacity availability of the site. The ingress routers
        can switch all or a portion of the instances associated with the site
        depending on how much the site is degraded.</t>

        <t>The BGP UPDATE for the individual instances (i.e., the routes) can
        include the Capacity Availability Index solely for ingress routers to
        associate the routes with the Side-ID. The actual Capacity
        Availability Index value, i.e., the percentage for all the routes
        associated with the Side-ID, is generated by the egress routers with
        the egress routers' loopback address as the NLRI.</t>

        <t>The Site Physical Availability Index Sub-TLV has fixed length of 8
        Octets, including the Type field. Therefore a Length field is not
        needed.</t>

        <t>The service-oriented capability Sub-TLV is for distributing
        information regarding the capabilities of a specific service in a

        environment can be an edge site or other types of environments. This
        information provides ingress routers or controllers with the available

		<t>Currently, the Sub-TLV only has
        an abstract value derived from various metrics, although the specifics

        this value is significant only when comparing multiple data center
        sites for the same service. This value is not meaningful when comparing
        different services, meaning the capability value relevant to Service A
        cannot be directly compared with that for Service B. Future
        enhancements may expand this sub-TLV to include more types of metrics
        or even raw data that represents direct metrics. This information is

    <section title="Service Metadata Propagation Scope">
      <t>The propagation scope of the Metadata Path Attribute needs careful consideration to ensure it does not inadvertently leak to other BGP domains. According to Section 3 of [ATTRIBUTE-ESCAPE], it is necessary for the Route Reflector (RR) to be upgraded to constrain the propagation scope when propagating the metadata path attributes. Therefore, the Metadata Path Attribute originator sets the attribute as Non-transitive when sending the BGP UPDATE message to its corresponding RR. Non-transitive attributes are only guaranteed to be dropped during BGP route propagation by implementations that do not recognize them, ensuring that the metadata path attributes do not propagate beyond the intended scope.
	  </t>
	  <t>The RR can append the NO-ADVERTISE well-known community to the BGP UPDATE message with the Metadata Path Attribute when forwarding it to the ingress routers. This signals to the ingress nodes that the associated route's Metadata Path Attribute should not be further advertised beyond their scope. This precautionary measure ensures that the receiver of the BGP UPDATE message refrains from forwarding the received update to its peers, preventing the undesired propagation of the information carried by the Metadata Path Attribute.
	  </t>
	  <t>In addition, the Service Metadata propagation can be further constrained to a set of ingress nodes that are specifically interested in the services. For example, for each registered low-latency Service, BGP RT Constrained Distribution <xref target="RFC4684"/> can be used to form a Group
      interested in the Service. The "Service ID", an IP address prefix, is
      the Route Target. When an ingress router receives the first packet of a
      flow destined to a Service ID (i.e., IP prefix), the ingress router
      sends a BGP UPDATE that advertises the Route Target membership NLRI per
      <xref target="RFC4684"/>. The ingress router must assign a Timer for the
      Service ID, as the UE that uses the Service ID might move away. Upon
      receiving a packet destined for the Service ID, the ingress router must
      refresh the Timer. The ingress router must send a BGP Withdraw UPDATE
      for the Service ID upon expiration of the Timer.</t>

      membership NLRI Advertisements.</t>

    <section title="Minimum Interval for Metrics Change Advertisement">
	  <t>Route Churn Considerations</t>

	  <t> While the mechanism detailed in this document aims to provide dynamic metrics like Capacity Availability Index, Site Delay Prediction Index, Service Delay Prediction Index, and Raw Measurement to optimize path selection, it is essential to consider the broader implications of metric-induced churn. Particularly, in the context of routes used for BGP nexthop resolution (e.g., labeled unicast), frequent changes in these metrics can lead to significant churn not only for the prefixes carrying the data but also for dependent routes.</t>

      <t>This behavior is analogous to the impacts observed with RSVP auto-bandwidth, which can introduce considerable instability within a network. Such route churn can propagate through the network, causing a cascade of updates and potential route flaps, thereby affecting overall network stability and performance.</t>

	  <t>To mitigate these effects, network operators should carefully manage the advertisement intervals of these dynamic metrics, ensuring they are set to avoid unnecessary churn. The default minimum interval for metrics change advertisement, set at 30 seconds, is designed to balance responsiveness with stability. However, in scenarios with higher sensitivity to route stability, operators may consider increasing this interval further to reduce the frequency of updates.</t>

	  <t> Furthermore, operators should implement robust route damping and filtering policies to control the propagation of changes and minimize the impact on dependent routes. By acknowledging and planning for these broader impacts, the mechanism can be deployed more effectively, ensuring optimal performance without compromising network stability.</t>
      
	  <t>Significant load changes at EC data centers can be triggered by
      short-term gatherings of UEs, like conventions, lasting a few hours or
      days. Therefore, the load metrics change rate can be in the
      magnitude of hours or days.</t>
	  
    </section>

    <section title="Validation and Error Handling">
      <t>In addition to the Error Handling procedure described in <xref
      target="RFC7606"/>, a BGP speaker should ignore the Metadata Path
      Attribute if more than one Metadata Path Attribute is within one BGP
      Update message.</t>

      <t>The Metadata Path Attribute contains a sequence of Sub-TLVs. The
      Metadata Path Attribute's length minus 1 determines the total number of
      octets for all the Sub-TLVs under the Metadata Path Attribute. The sum
      of the lengths from all the Sub-TLVs under the Metadata Path Attribute
      plus 1 should equal the length of the Metadata Path Attribute. If this
      is not the case, the TLV should be considered malformed, and the
      "Treat-as-withdraw" procedure of <xref target="RFC7606"/> is
      applied.</t>

      <t>When more than one sub-TLV is present in a Metadata Path Attribute,
      they are processed independently. Suppose a Metadata Path attribute can
      be parsed correctly but contains a Sub-TLV whose type is not recognized
      by a particular BGP speaker; that BGP speaker MUST NOT consider the
      attribute malformed. Instead, it MUST interpret the attribute as if that
      Sub-TLV had not been present. Logging the error locally or to a
      management system is optional. If the route carrying the Metadata path
      attribute is propagated with the attribute, the unrecognized Sub-TLV
      remains in the attribute.</t>

	<section title = "Service Delay Prediction Based on Load Measurement">
	  <t>When data centers detailed running status are not exposed to the
	  network operator, historic traffic patterns through the egress nodes
	  can be utilized to predict the load to a specific service. For
	  example, when traffic volume to one service at one data center
	  suddenly increases a huge percentage compared with the past 24 hours
	  average, it is likely caused by a larger than normal demand for the
	  service. When this happens, another data center with
	  lower-than-average traffic volume for the same service might have a
	  shorter processing time for the same service.</t>

	  <t>Here are some measurements that can be utilized to derive the
	  Service Delay Predication for a service ID:</t>

	  <list style="hanging">
		<t hangText="-">Total number of packets to the attached service
		instance (ToPackets);</t>

		<t hangText="-">Total number of packets from the attached service
		instance (FromPackets);</t>

		<t hangText="-">Total number of bytes to the attached service
		instance (ToBytes);</t>

		<t hangText="-">Total number of bytes from the attached service
		instance (FromBytes);</t>

		<t hangText="-">The actual load measurement to the service
		instance attached to an egress router can be based on one of the
		metrics above or including all four metrics with different weights
		applied to each, such as:</t>

		<t>LoadIndex =
		w1*ToPackets+w2*FromPackes+w3*ToBytes+w4*FromBytes</t>

		<t>Where w1/w2/w3/w4 are between 0-1. w1+ w2+ w3+ w4 = 1;</t>

		<t>The weights of each metric contributing to the index of the
		service instance attached to an egress router can be configured or
		learned by self-adjusting based on user feedbacks.</t>
	  </list>

	  <t>The Service Delay Prediction Index can be derived from
	  LoadIndex/24Hour-Average. A higher value means a longer delay
	  prediction. The egress router can use the ServiceDelayPred sub-TLV
	  to indicate to the ingress routers of the delay prediction derived
	  from the traffic pattern.</t>

	  <t>Note: The proposed IP layer load measurement is only an estimate
	  based on the amount of traffic through the egress router, which
	  might not truly reflect the load of the servers attached to the
	  egress routers. They are listed here only for some special
	  deployments where those metrics are helpful to the ingress routers
	  in selecting the optimal paths.</t>
	</section>
	    <section title="Service Metadata Influenced Decision Process">
      <section title="Egress Node Behavior">
        <t>Multiple instances of the same service could be attached to one
        egress router. When all instances of the same service are grouped
        behind one application layer load balancer, they appear as one single
        route to the egress router, i.e., the application loader balancer's
        prefix. Under this scenario, the compute metrics for all those
        instances behind one application layer balancer are aggregated under
        the application load balancer's prefix. In this case, the compute
        metrics aggregated by the Load Balancer are visible to the egress
        router as associated with the Load Balancer's prefix. However, how the
        application layer Load Balancers distribute the traffic among
        different instances is out of the scope of this document. When
        multiple instances of the same service have different paths or links
        reachable from the egress router, multiple groups of metrics from
        respective paths could be exposed to the egress router. The egress
        router can have preconfigured policies on aggregating various metrics
        from different paths and the corresponding policies in selecting a
        path for forwarding the packets received from ingress routers. The
        aggregated metrics can be carried in the BGP Update messages instead
        of detailed measurements to reduce the entries advertised by the
        control plane and dampen the routes update in the forwarding plane.
        Upon receiving packets from ingress routers, the egress router can use
        its policies to choose an optimal path to one service instance. It is
        out of the scope of this document how the measurements are aggregated
        on egress routers and how ingress routers are configured with the
        algorithms to integrate the aggregated metrics with network layer
        metrics.</t>

        <t>Many measurements could impact and correspondingly reflect service
        performance. In order to simplify an optimal selection process, egress
        routers can have preconfigured policies or algorithms to aggregate
        multiple metrics into one simple one to ingress routers. Though out of
        the scope of this document, an egress router can also have an
        algorithm to convert multiple metrics to network metrics, an IGP cost
        for each instance, to pass to ingress nodes. This decision-making
        process integrates network metrics computed by traditional IGP/BGP and
        the service delay metrics from egress routers to achieve a
        well-informed and adaptive routing approach. This intelligent
        orchestration at the edge enhances the service's overall performance
        and optimizes resource utilization across the distributed
        infrastructure. When the egress has merged the compute metrics from
        the local sites behind it, it can include one or more aggregated
        compute metrics in the Metadata Path Attribute in the BGP UPDATE to
        the Ingress. Also, an identifier or flag can be carried to indicate
        that the metrics are merged ones. After receiving the routes for the
        Service ID with the identifier, the ingress would do the route
        selection based on pre-configured algorithms (see Section 3 of this
        document).</t>

        situations. The goal is to integrate the conventional network decision
        process with the service Metadata into a unified decision-making
        process for path selection.</t>

      <section title="Integrating with BGP decision process">
        <t>When an ingress router receives BGP updates for the same IP address
        from multiple egress routers, all those egress routers are considered
        as the next hops for the IP address. For the selected services
        configured to be influenced by the edge service Metadata, the ingress
        router BGP Decision process [IDR-CUSTOM-DECISION] would trigger the
        edge service Management function to compute the weight to be applied
        to the route's next hop in the forwarding plane. The decision process
        is influenced by the edge service Metadata associated with the client
        routes, such as Capacity Availability Index, Site Preference, and
        Service Delay Prediction Index, in addition to the traditional BGP
        multipath computation algorithm, such as the Weight, Local preference,
        Origin, MED, etc., shown below:</t>

        <t>When any of those metadata value goes to 0, the effect is the same
        as the routes becoming ineligible via the egress router who originates
        the metadata UPDATE. But when any of those metadata just degrade,
        there is possibility, even though smaller, for the egress router to
        continue as the optimal next hop.</t>

        <t>Suppose a destination address for aa08::4450 can be reached by
        three next hops (R1, R2, R3). Further, suppose the local BGP's
        Decision Process based on the traditional network layer policies and
        metrics identifies the R1 as the optimal next hop for this destination
        (aa08::4450). If the edge service Metadata results in R2 as the
        optimal next hop for the prefix, the Forwarding Plane will have R2 as
        the next-hop for the destination address of aa08::4450.</t>

        <t>The edge service Metadata influencing next hop selection is
        different from the metric (or weight) to the next hop. The metric to a
        next hop can impact many (sometimes, tens of thousands) routes that
        have the node as their next hop. while as the edge service Metadata
        only impact the optimal next hop selection for a subset of client
        routes that are identified as the edge services.</t>

        <t>When the BGP custom decision [idr-custom-decision] is used, the
        edge service Management function would have algorithm to combine the
        edge service Metadata attributes with the custom decision to derive
        the optimal next hop for the Edge service routes.</t>

        <t>Note: For a BGP UPDATE message that includes the edge service
        Metadata Path Attribute with the RouteFlag-I=0 and the egress router's
        loopback prefix as the NLRI, the Site Capacity Availability Index
        value is applied to all the routes associated with the Site-ID.</t>
